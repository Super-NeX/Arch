# ArchNeX

Hello There this is my First Linux Distro I have created !!!

Get Arch Linux ISO Image :
--
https://archlinux.org/download/ (Version May Vary)

Get a Virtual Machine Manager:
--
1. Virtual Box (My Preferred)
2. VM Ware 

Boot Arch ISO
--
Boot the ISO in the Virtual Machine
From the Initial Prompt after booting

Type the Commands One By One

```
pacman -Sy git
```
```
git clone https://github.com/Super-NeX/ArchNeX
```
```
cd ArchNeX
```
```
./archnex.sh
```

Boom and Done !! The Scripts will Do everything for Ya! Sit back and Get a Coffee as this will take time depending on your Internet Connection.


Handling the Prompts
--
There will be some Prompts Along the way. The commands work on the belief that you are Either Installing on a Virtual Box or a Computer with a Blank Drive

*For Disk Work*
```
/dev/sda
```

*For User Account*

Type the Username and a 4-Digit *(Number is Preferred)* Password (As Easy as that LoL)


No Wifi
--
If you boot Directly on a Computer Via USB or something and are not able to use Wifi the use the following Command

```
sudo wifi-menu
```
